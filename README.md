**Imaginary** – a Minecraft mod which gives an abilitiy to add images to Minecraft. This mod supports any formats that Minecraft supports for textures (**PNG**, **JPEG** and **GIF** without animations). This mod is built for Minecraft 1.10.2 and Forge 12.18.3.2185. No compatibility with multiplayer available yet (it's planned for next update, though).

Thanks goes to [Tom Soel](https://twitter.com/TomSoel/) for reminding me of the idea for this mod.

## Install

Install [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/), download the latest stable version of jar file for available minecraft version. Put it in minecraft's `mods` folder, and launch the game.

After that, Imaginary mod should be installed and will appear in Minecraft's mods menu. If Imaginary didn't appear in the mods menu, then something went wrong. 

## How to use

Imaginary mod adds picture item which allows you to add pictures into your world. Simply drag it from Miscellaneous creative tab, or craft it using following recipe:

After you acquired a picture item, you should be able to place a custom picture on any surface. When picture is placed, you can right click it and change some properties of your picture. To pick a picture, you'll have to populate Imaginary's mod picture folder (which is located in `.minecraft/config/imaginary/pictures`) with your **PNG**, **JPEG** or **GIF** pictures. After you dropped your pictures into the pictures folder, you should be able to pick these pictures in picture's GUI.
