# Imaginary Change Log

You totally see what I did there, didn't you? I should've called this mod Stickers, but Imaginary sounds much better!

## Version 1.0.3

This is a small patch update. It was used in Aperture's teaser.

- Added **config**
- Added two config options
	- **Disable image lighting** – discards lighting tinting based on direction of which image is facing
	- **Enable linear filtering** – makes pictures render smoothly (instead of pixelized)
- Fixes issue with The One Probe (finally)
- Makes pictures render all the time

## Version 1.0.2

This is a quick patch update which mostly aims at making Imaginary mod more survival friendly.

- Added recipe for making a *Picture* item ([recipe screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/2qAR3vd.png))
